First, I made a chart of the alphabet and looked to see if there were any single letter words in the cipher. Seeing that the  first word was just 'L', I determined that it could be either A or I. Guessing A first, I created a shifted by 11 alphabet under my original alphabet to decode the cipher. Getting 'OAKZ' as the second word, I knew that solution was wrong. Pivoting to the letter I as the first word, I then shifted the alphabet by 3. Thus resulting in the second word, 'WISH' and I finished the code.
